// Here's the simplest explanation of what this **Sampling Plan Uploader** component does:

// ---

// ### **What This Is**  
// A digital form where **quality checkers (IQAs)** can:  
// 1. **Create inspection plans**  
//    - "We'll check 20 student portfolios every month"  
//    - "Review Sarah's assessments by June 15th"

// 2. **Save all details in one place**  
//    - Upload the plan document (PDF/Word)  
//    - Select which teachers/students to review  
//    - Set deadlines  

// ---

// ### **What Problems It Solves**  
// ✅ **No more lost paperwork** - Everything gets saved securely in the system  
// ✅ **Easy tracking** - See who needs reviewing and when  
// ✅ **Audit ready** - Creates a paper trail for external inspectors  

// ---

// ### **Real-Life Example**  
// 1. *Mrs. Johnson (IQA) needs to check 30 student projects*  
// 2. She uses this tool to:  
//    - Name the plan: "May 2024 Project Review"  
//    - Upload her checklist  
//    - Select which 30 students to review  
//    - Choose the deadline (May 31)  
// 3. Now:  
//    - The system remembers her plan  
//    - External inspectors can see it  
//    - She gets reminders as the deadline approaches  

// ---

// ### **Key Parts**  
// - **File Upload** - For the actual plan document  
// - **Checkboxes** - To pick which teachers/students to review  
// - **Calendar** - To set deadlines  
// - **History** - Shows past plans (version control)  

// It's like a **digital filing cabinet** specifically for quality checks in education - keeping everything organized and traceable.
